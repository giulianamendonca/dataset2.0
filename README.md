# Dataset Generator 2.0
Customizable random dataset generator with uniform and triangular distributions.

## Description
Like its predecessor, the [OG Dataset Generator](https://giulianamendonca.pythonanywhere.com/), this tool is designed allow the generation of random datasets based on custom parameters. This new version introduces distribution control, enabling users to generate values based on **uniform** or **triangular** distributions for more realistic data simulation.

### Backstory
I created the original version of this dataset generator in early 2024 as the final project for the CS50x course. For this new version, I've kept the flexibility of the OG generator and added the ability to choose the distribution of the data: uniform or triangular.

### Key Features
This tool generates datasets with the following customizable parameters:
* Number of rows
* Length of each set (number of columns)
* Number of digits in each number
* Distribution type
* Mode (if **triangular**)

The number of digits is given by three parameters: minimum/maximum digits and a "currency" switch, which adds two decimal points to the numbers.

## Requirements
* Python 3.11+
* Standard Libraries:
  * random
  * csv
  * dataclasses
* Additional Libraries
  * pytest (for testing)

## File Structure
```
project.py       # Main program
test_project.py  # Test suite (pytest)
README.md        # Documentation
```

## Usage
1. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python project.py
   ```
2. Enter the following parameters when prompted:
  * Number of rows (sets)
  * Number of columns (length per set)
  * Minimum and maximum digits per number
  * Type of distribution (uniform or triangular)
    Mode, as a percentage of the min-max range (if triangular distribution).
  * Currency conversion (Y/N)
3. The program will generate a CSV file (e.g. `dataset_12345.csv`) in the same directory.

## Implementation Details
The main program is implemented in `project.py`.

### Classes
* **Parameters class**
  * This class was created using a dataclass, in order to make it easier to store all the required information. Its contents are as follows:
    * rows: int
    * columns: int
    * min_digits: int
    * max_digits: int
    * distribution: str
    * mode: float
    * currency_flag: bool

### Functions
* **main()**
  * Coordinates parameter collection, label generation, and file creation.

* **get_parameters()**
  * Prompts the user for the parameters needed for generation. Returns a `Parameters` object.
    * Checks if `min_digits` and `max_digits` are valid (i.e., if the minimum number of digits is equal to or less than the maximum). If invalid, the following error message is displayed before reprompting:
    `min must be less than or equal to max`
    * Adjusts the number of min/max digits based on the currency_flag (adds 2 extra digits to the user-submitted values when currency is set to True)

* **get_number(text)**
  * Prompts the user for a positive integer. Reprompts until valid input is submitted.

* **get_distribution()**
  * Prompts the user to select the desired distribution:
    * **Uniform (U)**: Numbers are evenly distributed within the range.
    *  **Triangular (T)**: Numbers follow a triangular distribution with a user-defined mode.

* **get_label()**
  * Selects the random number that will serve as suffix for the name of the file generated by the program.
  * To ensure reproductibility (required by future features), this number is also used as seed for the generation of the dataset itself.

* **create_file(label, parameters)**
  * Generates the dataset, based on the given parameters.
  * Writes the generated data to a .csv file in the same directory as the program, named as:
  ```
  filename = "dataset_" + str(label) + ".csv"
  ```

* **get_digits(label, parameters)**
  * Returns a list of digit counts for each row.
    * The numbers are chosen randomly, using `label` as seed, from the range between `min_digits` and `max_digits`.

* **get_range(digits_number)**
  * Finds the upper and lower bounds for each row, determined as:
  ```
  lowest = 10 ** (digits_number - 1)
  highest = 10 ** digits_number - 1
  ```

### Test Functions
Tests are implemented in `test_project.py` using **pytest**. They cover:
- `get_number()`
- `get_distribution()`
- `get_digits()`
- `get_range()`

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest test_project.py
```

## Known Issues
* Like in V1, there is no automatic clean-up for generated files. They must be deleted manually.
* V2.0 only allows for a single distribution/mode to be set for all sets. For different distributions or modes, multiple generations are required.

## Next features
Possible features for next versions:
* **Automatic file deletion**

* **Customization of distribution and mode per row**

* **Saved sets**
  * I'm studying the feasibility (and usefulness) of developing a tool for recreating previously generated sets.

* **Web version**
  * Adding a graphical interface for non-CLI usage.
